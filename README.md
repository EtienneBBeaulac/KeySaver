# KeySaver
Senior Project intended to resolve the common loss of typed work caused by either negligence or pure bad luck.

## Are you sick of losing everything you've typed?
The introduction of autosave has been a fantastic leap into a world of no-loss. However, sometimes you still lose your stuff, especially when it is written on the web.

This is a sort of key logger that enables the user to record their keystrokes and look back at their history in case something goes horribly wrong and they lose all their hard work, their heart sinking into their stomachs, and their desire to commit unfortunate acts―such as throwing their laptops across the room or flipping a desk (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ ―increases to uncontrollable levels.

Development in progress.
